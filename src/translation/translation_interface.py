        This method handles the entire translation pipeline:
        1. Analyzing context and generating initial summary in source language 
        2. Optimizing segments (e.g., merging adjacent segments from same speaker)
        3. Chunking segments into logical groups
        4. Translating chunks
        5. Decomposing translated chunks back to segment level
